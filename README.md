## Featured: [DGX sPLIce](https://github.com/ProprietaryLegal/DGX-sPLIce-DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-2xDGX-Spark-2xRTX3090-drafter-x86-offload)

**DGX sPLIce: DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash on 2x DGX Spark + 2x RTX 3090 drafter, x86 offload.** Two NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10)
nodes serve the model in tensor parallel; an ordinary x86 machine holds the Engram tables in RAM and serves them over
RDMA, and runs the DSpark speculative drafter on a pair of RTX 3090s. The memory this frees on the Sparks goes to KV
cache.

PLI Labs is the open research arm of Proprietary Legal Intelligence. We publish methods, code, and measured results so you can inspect the work before hiring us. PLI builds AI around a legal organization's own work product, with retrieval, staged workflows, validation, and attorney review.
